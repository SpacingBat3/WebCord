A Discord Web App made with the [Electron API](https://github.com/electron/electron), developed with the [Electron Forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge).

It is completely indepenendent from [Discord-Electron](https://github.com/GyozaGuy/Discord-Electron), but I've maintained a fork of it before, which I used to learn about the Electron itself and implementing a Discord web app with it. So, thank you, [@GyozaGuy](https://github.com/GyozaGuy), without that code this project could not exist.
