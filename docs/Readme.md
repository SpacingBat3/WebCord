A Discord and [Fosscord] *API-less* client made with the [Electron][electron].

The main reason for the existence of WebCord has previously been to create a usable ARM
alternative, but nowadays it's development is more focused on making it a *more open*
alternative to the Discord client, which would be both customisable and
improving in some aspects like security and privacy. As for now, some tweaks
around privacy has been implemented:

  - blocking third-party websites via customisable CSP,
  - blocking unnecessary services and tracers with custom CSP, like [Sentry],
  - blocking known Discord tracing API requests (`/science` and `/tracing`)
    by the default,
  - optionally blocking typing indicator (`/typing`).
  
Please note many features I have plans for haven't been implemented yet â€“ you can
find more about that [in this file](Features.md).

WebCord takes a different approach from most clients, as it isn't just a mod of
the official client nor does it use the Discord API to be functional â€“ it is
currently based on the web version of the Discord, trying to protect the users
from being detected as third-party client. It also does a bit more to hide all
changes it made:

  - Chrome/Chromium user-agent spoofing (Discord treats WebCord as the regular
    browser),

  - spoofing some functions modifications as native (so Discord should treat
    them same way as they wouldn't be touched by WebCord),

  - hiding the content over removing it (so it can't be simply detected by
    watching the changes to the HTML code; Discord would need to also watch for
    the changes within the each of the elements style to detect client designed
    like that).

This project at first was a fork of the [Discord-Electron], but then eventually
I had rewritten it as *Electron Discord Web App* project, which is currently
called *WebCord* (to make that horribly long name a bit shorter ðŸ˜‰). However,
because [@GyozaGuy](https://github.com/GyozaGuy) made his own project, I learnt
much about Electron and how to implement a Discord client with it by analysing
his code. Thanks to his work, this project could begin on its own.

## Documentation:

For newcomers I recommend to read at least the [FAQ](FAQ.md) (to fix common issues and not report them as *bugs*). 
You may also read [Features](Features.md) to know which features have been implemented and are supported. 
It is strongly advised to read the [application license](../LICENSE) as well.
