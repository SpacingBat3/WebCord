A Discord and [Fosscord] web-based client made with the [Electron API][electron],
developed with [Electron Forge][electron-forge].

The main reason of the WebCord existence was previously creating a usable ARM
alternative, but nowadays it's developement is more around making it *more open*
alternative to the Discord client, which would be both customizable and improving in some
aspects like the security and privacy. As for now, some tweaks around 
privacy has been implemented:

  - Blocking third-party websites via customizable CSP. \
  - Blocking unnecesary services and tracers with custom CSP, like [Sentry]. \
  - Blocking known Discord tracing API requests (`/science` and `/tracing`)
    by the default. \
  - Optionally blocking typing indicator (`/typing`).
  
Please note that many of the features I have plans for, haven't been implemented yet â€“
you can find more about that [in this file](Features.md).

WebCord takes a differend approach from most clients, as it isn't just a mod of
the official client nor does it use the Discord API to be functional â€“ it is
currently based on the web version of the Discord, trying to protect the users
from being detected as third-party client. It also does a bit more to hide all the
changes it makes:

  - Chrome/Chromium user-agent spoofing (Discord treats WebCord as the regular
    browser). \

  - Spoofing some functions modifications as native (so Discord will treat the
    same way as it wouldn't be touched by WebCord). \

  - Hiding the content over removing it (so it can't be simply detected by
    watching the changes to the HTML code; Discord would need to also watch for
    the changes within the each of the elements style to detect client designed
    like that).

This project at first was a fork of the [Discord-Electron], but then eventually
I had rewritten it as *Electron Discord Web App* project, which is currently
called *WebCord* (to make that horribly long name a bit shorter ðŸ˜‰). However,
because [@GyozaGuy](https://github.com/GyozaGuy) made his own project, I learnt
much about Electron and how to implement a Discord client with it by analyzing
his code. Thanks to his work, this project could begin on its own.
