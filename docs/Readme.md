A Discord web-based client made with the [Electron API](https://github.com/electron/electron),
developed with [Electron Forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge).

WebCord tries to enchance a little more user privacy by allowing the user to block any
third-party website by overwritting website CSP header to the one configured via the settings.
It also blocks some unnecesary services as well, like [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

WebCord takes a differend approach from most clients, as it isn't just a mod of the official
client nor does it use the Discord API to be functional â€“ it is currently based on the web
version of the Discord, which makes it more trusted solution in my opinion. As it even fakes
the user agent to make it equal or similar to the one used by Chrome/Chromium, it is hard to
detect it and block users from using it.

It began as a fork of the [Discord-Electron](https://github.com/GyozaGuy/Discord-Electron),
but then eventually I had rewritten it as *Electron Discord Web App* project, which is
currently called *WebCord* (to make that horribly long name a bit shorter ðŸ˜‰). However
because [@GyozaGuy](https://github.com/GyozaGuy) made his own project, I learnt much about
Electron and how to implement a Discord with it by analyzing his code. Thanks to his work,
this project could begin on its own.
