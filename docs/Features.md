## List of currently implemented (and planned) WebCord's features

Because WebCord is based on Discord Website and (unlike official client and
client mods) does not use any of the Discord's proprietary Node.js C++ native
modules nor fake itself as an official Discord client (but rather as a Chromium
browser), it has similar features and limitations like Discord Web application.
However, WebCord client is capable of doing some tweaks to it, implementing
following list of the features:

| Name | Description | State / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tray icon | Hiding application in the tray. | ‚úÖÔ∏è Done |
| Red badge (tray) | Display indicator at DM or mentions on tray icon. | ‚úÖÔ∏è Done |

| In-app documentation browser | Built-in Markdown reader for offline documentation files. | ‚úÖÔ∏è Done |
| Splash screen on load | Display animated splash screen before loading Discord. | ‚úÖÔ∏è Done |
| Permission management | Lets you decide what Discord can do and what it can't. | ‚úÖÔ∏è Done |

| Hide download buttons/popups | Hide elements referring to official Discord client download link | ‚úÖÔ∏è Done |
| HTML-based *about* panel | Non-native window showing the information about the application, like licenses, versions or credits. | 2Ô∏è‚É£ ***Beta*** (it's actively improved) |
| Custom Discord and WebCord styles | Allow styling Discord and WebCord with own themes. | 1Ô∏è‚É£ ***Alpha*** (Only Discord can be styled) |
| Answer to invite URLs | Replies to guild invite links (like official Discord client). | ‚úÖÔ∏è Done |
| Navigate using external web browser | Handle navigation requests via WebSocket | ‚úÖÔ∏è Done |
| Application data encryption | Encrypt application files to prevent tinkering with it by the third-party software. | 2Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è ***Beta*** (improvements are planned) |

describes a feature that is not on the list, you may consider opening a

there, feel free to inform me about that in the *Issues* or *Discussions*. If
you are talented enough, you could also implement them yourself and do a Pull

### State legend:
 
 - ‚ùåÔ∏è **TODO** ‚Äì this feature **may** or **may not** be implemented in the
   future. It's in *concept* state ‚Äì there's nothing implemented about it and it
   might not be implemented soon, even if it is ever planned to be done.

-  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Will do** ‚Äì there's nothing implemented in code about this feature, but
   it is planned as a next feature to be worked on.

 - 1Ô∏è‚É£ ***Alpha*** ‚Äì the work on implementing this feature has already begun, but
   it's still far from being finished.
 
 - Ô∏è2Ô∏è‚É£Ô∏è ***Beta*** ‚Äì this feature has been mostly implemented, but it still needs
   to be polished before being marked as *done*. This indicates that this
   feature will be actively worked on to adapt it for the new changes, find a
   better implementation and so on.

 - ‚úÖÔ∏è **Done** ‚Äì this feature has been fully implemented and there's no need to
   actively work on it.
 
 - ‚õîÔ∏è **Broken** ‚Äì this feature has been working, but it recently stopped
   working either due to some Discord and/or WebCord updates.

 - üößÔ∏è ***Under construction*** ‚Äì A major rewrite around this feature is in
   progress to improve it.

### Experimental features

Here are some notes about the features that are still not visibly implemented
and are far from being called *user-friendly*. Things are meant here to be
broken, so don't expect you will be able to use them as you intent to.

#### 1. Custom Discord Styles

Since version `3.0.0`, WebCord is capable of styling Discord pages ‚Äì unlike
browser extensions like Stylus it does that without injecting any HTML elements
to the page, to be more difficult to detect the modifications. On the other
hand, the injected stylesheets can be easily overwritten by Discord CSS for some
properties, which could be prevented with the `!important` rule. Moreover, using
`@import` keyword for referencing an another CSS stylesheet wouldn't work at all
as well and needed to be resolved before injection. That is why the
implementation up to WebCord `3.1.3` was so problematic and didn't play well
with most already pre-made Discord themes.

However, it is now greatly improved since `3.1.4` release ‚Äì most themes, which
does not rely on remote content like images and fonts, should be now mostly
functional, since WebCord is currently capable of resolving `@import` statements
and fixing the themes on the fly to make Chromium render them correctly. The
only issue now is to allow styles to provide their own Content Security Policy
in order to allow loading the remote content needed for scripts to function
properly.

Currently WebCord loads CSS themes from `{userData}/Themes/` directory when
they ends with `.theme.css` extension, like most BetterDiscord themes does.

However, in the future releases WebCord will encrypt themes with `safeStorage`
in approach to prevent tinkering with it by third-party software after it is
added to WebCord in order to improve the security especially in the future
releases where it is planned that WebCord allow themes to modify its CSP in some
way. This breaks with loading themes through `.theme.css` files and adds
`--add-css-theme` flag as an alternative.

#### 2. Chrome Extensions

From version `3.0.0`, WebCord can load unpacked Chrome extensions using
Electron's [Chrome Extension Support][chrome-ext]. Since Electron implementation
of Chrome extensions is far from the one in Chromium (which is due to the fact
Electron removes a lot of browser-specific code in Chromium's code), a lot of
extensions may not be fully functional or not work at all.

This is why a WebCord-specific implementation of the extensions is considered to
be done in the future in which case Chromium extensions might be deprecated
and / or removed.

You can load Chromium extensions by extracting them from `.crx` archive to
`{userData}/Extensions/Chromium/{extension name}/` folder.
