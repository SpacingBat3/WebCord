            I have verified this issue is not a bug within Chromium engine by
            checking, if this bug can be reproduced in Discord web on
            Chromium/Chrome or any other Chromium-based browser that uses
            unpatched/upstream Chromium engine (i.e. browsers which treats
            fixing Chromium bugs out of their scope and doesn't do anything
            about them, either to patch or mitigate them).
